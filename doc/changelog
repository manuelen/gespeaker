gespeaker (0.4) all; urgency=medium

  * Added SubprocessWrapper.Popen to wrap subprocess.Popen in order to
    support python versions prior to 2.6 which don't have the delete
    argument on object creation.
  * Added TempfileWrapper.NamedTemporaryFile to wrap tempfile's Popen
    object in order to support python versions prior to 2.6 which don't
    have terminate and send_signal methods.
    Actually no more used, left for future usage.
  * Now gespeaker works with python version 2.4 and higher.
  * Temporary file for output to speech is created at program start so
    new temporary files are no longer created after each play.
  * Included pause and resume features.
  * New icon and logo, kindly provided by MIX.
  * New french translation provided by Emmanuel.
